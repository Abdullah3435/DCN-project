Server and Client folders are separate 

MOST IMPORTANT :

The client will download files in the client downloads folder

1) Compile both server and client code

2) Run Both the server and the client in separate terminals

3) server will provide any files to the client that are present in the Server directory.

4) Upon running client you will recieve a prompt to tell the server which file you want and how many threads you want the file in if command line args are NOT provided

5) Alternatively you can run the tests.sh case files as well but have to provide the file names CORRECTLY in the test.sh for each file

6) Some test files are already provided in the server folder but due to canvas size limitation i have not put very large files but large files will also be sent successfully...

7) you can compile and Abdullahtests.sh to run the files i have provided

8) SOmetimes there is a BIND error kndly wait 30-40 seconds before attempting again and wait for the server to close.

9) Server runs indefinitely as well teh best use still is to manually open 2 separate terminals to make sure you manually run the server and the client and do not depend on the tests.sh file entirely
